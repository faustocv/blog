![My Profile Photo](/assets/img/profile_photo.png)

Christ believer, technology consultant, and software developer. My daily work is to help solve problems using open source technologies.

My focus areas are Sofware Development, DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Cloud, TDD (Testing Driven Development), IoT (Internet of Things) and Linux containers.

I firmly believe that the world can be better through sharing knowledge and experiences. And I pretty convinced that everyone has something to share. When you share your learning with other people, you will learn even more.
